# Template Menu Next.js

This template is only intended as a template for your own projects. There are links, but they have no goals.

The links are in the index.js as an array.
Code:

`  const navElements = [
    { id: 1, name: "Home", link: "#" },
    { id: 2, name: "About", link: "#" },
    { id: 3, name: "Contact", link: "#" },
    { id: 4, name: "Ganz langer Text", link: "#" },
  ];`
